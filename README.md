# BUPC LibMS | Library Management System
Library Management System is a basic C++ program was created by Computer Engineering Students at Bicol University Polangui Campus for a project in Data Structure and Algorithm Subject. It is a basic Library Managing Console Program that lets you add a borrowed book and list it inside its database. 

***Features:*** 
 - Add Students that Borrowed Books
 - Delete Students via Unique ID generated by the program
 - Login and Registration System
 - Counts the usage of books by the Students
 - Show the list of books depending on the Category


# BUPC LibMS | LOG IN MENU
This is the Login Menu, the blue line is for navigation, the user will need to use the arrow keys to move across the menu.

# MAIN MENU
This is the Main Menu which serves as the main user interface where the user (preferrably a teacher) will be able to add books, see the books borrowed, scrape through the list of books inside the database, and see the top recommended books based on its usage count. This is where most of the works is done, and like the login menu, you can navigate through it using the arrow keys.

# BUPC LibMS | What this Project is all about

This project is about organizing library data and the list of books borrowed by the BUPC Engineering students. This
is in order to monitor the transactions taking place within the library. The features of the system are the following: it
starts by having the registration and log in system to begin recording the student details, students get to borrow books
in an organized manner, the system lets the user check the list of borrowed books, unique ID’s are provided to each of
the borrowed books, deadlines can also be set up, a student can be deleted from the student records, it can list the
books from the database, it shows the most used books as a list which depends on the usage points, the usage points
being the frequency of how many times a certain book is borrowed or used by the students. This program can only be
used by the teachers while the students are the ones being recorded which comes with their following details. We
chose this project for the reason that it is convenient for the school, the students, and the teachers. The functionalities
of the program use data structures such as arrays and vectors, and sorting algorithms, aside from that, the system
itself requires such program, the vectors are dynamic which are applicable to the purpose of the program. The reason
we focus more on using vectors arrays, it is because of its flexibility and efficiency over handling the data given to it.


# BUPC LibMS | Methodology

The whole class conducted a meeting before anything else, to discuss the idea of the project that will be pursued
as the topic for the final program. Once the idea was finalized, the class was divided into groups and each group was
given a task to fulfill. Finding references was the next step in order to have a better plan and execution of the whole
program. The references were then compiled, each group proceeded into brainstorming on how each piece of
information would be puzzled. This information was then given to those people who could program well enough. The
paper was finalized right after the program was done. The paper contains the details about the project, the process
and some other necessary info. Some of the useful algorithms were used in this project, here are the list: Sorting
Algorithm (Insertion), Class Constructors, Struct Classes, Vector Arrays, Arrays, ifstream, ofstream, for and while loops
statements, included algo, and header files. For color features we used coloring header files, and for sound effects we
used windows.h headers. Some of the codes were taken from the internet but these codes were only used for
formality and aesthetic purposes.

# BUPC LibMS | Conclusion

***How can Data Structure and Algorithm help you in your future projects?***


We use data structure in our everyday lives without even knowing it. From our contact list, book piles to
organizing hierarchy or to-do list, we are applying different arrangement techniques which are called a data
structure in the computing realm. Data structure provides the right way to organize information in the digital
space. The data structure is a key component of Computer Science and is largely used in the areas of Artificial
Intelligence, operating systems, graphics, etc. In future projects we can apply Data structures in making
projects and designs as it is crucial part of designing an efficient software. This also play a critical role in
algorithm design and how those algorithms are used within computer programs. DSA help us to find efficient solutions
this can indeed be multiple ways to solve a software engineering problem. But we always need to choose the most 
efficient and practical solution to avoid bad performance issues that may happen in the future.

***What are the possible considerations when selecting Data Structure and Algorithm?***

- (1) Analyze your problem to determine the basic operations that must be supported. Examples of basoperations include inserting a data item into the data structure, deleting a data item from the data structureand finding a specified data item.
- (2) Quantify the resource constraints for each operation.
- (3) Select the data structure that best meets these requirements.


This three-step approach to selecting a data structure operationalizes a data-centered view of the desigprocess. The first concern is for the data and the operations to be performed on them, the next concern is threpresentation for those data, and the final concern is the implementation of that representation. Resourcconstraints on certain key operations, such as search, inserting data records, and deleting data recordnormally drive the data structure selection process. Many issues relating to the relative importance of thesoperations are addressed by the following three questions, which you should ask yourself whenever you muchoose a data structure.
Each data structure has associated costs and benefits. In practice, it is hardly ever true that one data structuris better than another for use in all situations. If one data structure or algorithm is superior to another in arespects, the inferior one will usually have long been forgotten. For nearly every data structure and algorithm presented in this book, you will see examples of where it is the best choice. Some of the examples mighsurprise you.
A data structure requires a certain amount of space for each data item it stores, a certain amount of time tperform a single basic operation, and a certain amount of programming effort. Each problem has constrainon available space and time. Each solution to a problem makes use of the basic operations in some relativproportion, and the data structure selection process must account for this. Only after a careful analysis of youproblem’s characteristics can you determine the best data structure for the task.
